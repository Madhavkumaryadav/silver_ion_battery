- Solids loading target (typical trial range 25-45 wt%)

Actions:
- Dry-blend active and conductive components first
- Add binder phase incrementally
- Tune viscosity using solvent in small increments
- Continue mixing until texture is uniform and stable

## Phase 6: Drying, Densification, and Electrode Conditioning

Objective:
- Remove solvent and set electrode microstructure.

Inputs:
- Coated sheets

Actions:
- Dry with controlled temperature-time profile
- Apply optional calendaring to hit target density or porosity window
- Rest electrodes before cutting

Checkpoints:

## Phase 7: Cutting, Mass Loading, and Dimensional QA

Objective:
- Produce geometry-controlled electrodes with traceable loading values.

Inputs:
- Dried electrodes

## Phase 8: Cell Assembly and Electrolyte Wetting

Objective:
- Build a short-free cell stack with complete ionic wetting.

Inputs:
- Cathode, separator, counter electrode, electrolyte

Actions:
- Assemble in correct layer order and polarity
- Add electrolyte in measured increments
- Allow soak time for uniform wetting before sealing

Checkpoints:
- No misalignment that can cause edge short
- No dry separator region remains
- Seal integrity visually confirmed

- Sealed trial cell ready for formation

## Phase 9: Formation Cycling

Objective:
- Stabilize interfaces and establish reproducible early-cycle behavior.

Inputs:
- Assembled and sealed cell

Actions:
- Run low-rate charge and discharge cycles
- Include rest periods to capture relaxation behavior
- Record voltage and current with consistent sampling interval

Checkpoints:
- No abnormal voltage excursion

## Phase 10: Baseline Characterization and Parameter Extraction

Objective:
- Convert test data to simulation-ready ECM parameters.

Inputs:
- Formation and pulse-test datasets
